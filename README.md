# SKO 2023 - PingOne Authorize

This repo contains the configuration that will be discussed in the P1AZ session.

## Folders

`terraform` - Contains the HCL to create as much as possible of the PingOne Environment
`davinci` - Contains a DaVinci flow used in the Labs
`policies` - Contains the Policy sets for the Labs

## Terraform

Terraform HCL is provided to create the PingOne Environment that is needed for the P1AZ Trust Framework and Policies.

To execute, clone this repo and do the following:

Add a `terraform.tfvars` file to the cloned `terraform` folder.

```hcl
region = "{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
organization_id = "{{orgId}}"
admin_env_id = "{{adminEnvId}}"
admin_user_id = "{{adminUserId}}"
worker_id = "{{workerId}}"
worker_secret = "{{workerSecret}}"
deploy_name = "SKO2023 - PingOne Authorize"
```

Replace `{{ ... }}` with your PingOne details

At a command line:

```hcl
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values. 

If the plan succeeds:

```hcl
terraform apply â€”auto-approve
````

Terraform should execute and display a set of values that need to be manually entered into the created PingOne users
